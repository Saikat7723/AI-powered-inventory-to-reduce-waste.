# AI‑Powered Inventory to Reduce Waste 🧠📦

This project implements an AI-driven inventory management system aimed at reducing waste and optimizing stock levels using demand forecasting and dynamic replenishment.

## 🎯 Features

- **Historical demand analysis** using ML models (e.g., LSTM or regression).
- **Real‑time inventory tracking** via IoT or database monitoring.
- **Dynamic ordering system** that automatically places restock orders based on predicted need.
- **Waste reduction logic** to flag overstock scenarios and expiry risks.
- **Dashboard/UI** for visualizing inventory levels, forecast accuracy, and waste metrics.

## ⚙️ Architecture

| Component              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Data Ingestion        | Pulls sales, returns, and spoilage data periodically |
| Forecast Model        | LSTM/ML model predicting short‑term demand |
| Replenishment Engine | Calculates reorder thresholds and triggers orders |
| Waste Analyzer        | Detects deadstock and expiry trends |
| Frontend Dashboard    | Shows insights, alerts, and historical trends |

## 🛠️ Installation
